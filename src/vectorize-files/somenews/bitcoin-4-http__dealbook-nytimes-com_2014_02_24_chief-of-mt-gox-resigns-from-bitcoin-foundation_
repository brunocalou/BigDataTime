Mark Karpeles, the chief executive of Mt. Gox, once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, has resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.His resignation was confirmed in a brief statement on the foundation’s website. It said the resignation was effective immediately. Mt. Gox was one of three elected industry representatives on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation. The foundation said it would announce election procedures in the future.The resignation is the latest blow to Mt. Gox and Bitcoin.Mt. Gox, which is based in Tokyo, almost shut down this month after discovering that customers could make transactions disappear from its records. While that appeared at first to be a problem limited solely to Mt. Gox, it spread to several other large exchanges, and the Bitcoin Foundation acknowledged that it was a flaw that developers had long been aware of. That disclosure served as the starting gun for a wave of hacker attacks on the main exchanges. The problems at Mt. Gox prompted CoinDesk to remove it from its Bitcoin price index. Mt. Gox’s resignation is also the second prominent one in the last month.  Charles Shrem stepped down from the board late last month after he was arrested and charged with money laundering in connection with his Bitcoin exchange company. He pleaded not guilty.
