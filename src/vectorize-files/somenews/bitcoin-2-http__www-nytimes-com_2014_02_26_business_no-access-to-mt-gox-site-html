The website of Mt. Gox, the troubled Bitcoin exchange, appears to have been taken down, shortly after six other major Bitcoin exchanges released a statement distancing themselves from Mt. Gox.The home page of the site, based in Tokyo, could not be entered during Tuesday afternoon in Asia, and no error message appeared. Bitcoin exchanges allow their users to trade Bitcoins for dollars and other currencies. This month, Mt. Gox — once the largest exchange handling Bitcoins — said it was halting withdrawals indefinitely after it detected “unusual activity.”“This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company’s actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry,” the other exchanges — Bitstamp, Blockchain, BTC China, Circle, Coinbase and Kraken — said in the statement.Mt. Gox was not immediately available for comment.“As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today,” the companies said. “Mt. Gox has confirmed its issues in private discussions with other members of the Bitcoin community.”On Sunday, Mark Karpeles, the chief executive of Mt. Gox, resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation in a blow to the digital currency. It was a founding member of the foundation and had one of the three elected industry representatives on the board.The resignation followed a number of technical problems, including a huge cyberattack from unknown sources that has sent a barrage of spam to Bitcoin exchanges.“There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in Bitcoin,” the six exchanges said in the statement. “These companies will continue to build the future of money by making Bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants.”
